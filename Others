Git Clone

git clone is how you get a local copy of an existing repository to work on. It's usually only used once for a given repository, unless you want to have multiple working copies of it around. .

git pull

Update the local repo with new commits from the remote repo

Git fetch

Fetch is similar to pull, except it won’t do any merging.
1	%> git checkout localBranch
2	 %> git fetch origin remoteBranch
3	%> git branch
4	master
5	* localBranch
6	remoteBranch
